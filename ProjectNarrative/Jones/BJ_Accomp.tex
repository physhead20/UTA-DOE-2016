\section*{\textbf{Plans}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As a new faculty member at UTA, I am involved in two primary research activities: 1) exploitation of beyond-standard-model neutrino physics capabilities of the IceCube detector, 2) development of high pressure xenon gas detectors for neutrinoless double beta decay.  The latter activitiy involves aspects of detector R\&D which have major symbioses with the needs of the DUNE and protoDUNE detectors.  As evidence of this, my past experience with liquid argon detectors is already proving to have a high degree of relevance for the challenges of realizing ton-scale high pressure xenon gas detectors.  Particular areas of overlap include light collection and high voltage distribution, where I have significant expertise.  Technology developed for pressure xenon gas detectors is equally expected to provide advances for liquid argon TPC detectors-  in the case of optical detection, these advances are much needed to achieve DUNE's ambitious low energy physics goals.  

Thus, in collaboration with the liquid-argon-focussed intensity frontier group at UTA, I would like to develop the presented generic photon detector R\&D concept, which will be of relevance for all detectors which rely on noble element scintillation light.  This collaborative R\&D research will be undertaken alongside work on the NEXT experiment and also the IceCube experiment, both to be funded from other sources.  At the end of this three year cycle, we plan to have optimized and demonstrated this concept in both liquid argon and xenon gas, and simulated its applicability for kiloton-scale LArTPC and ton-scale HPGXe detectors.
