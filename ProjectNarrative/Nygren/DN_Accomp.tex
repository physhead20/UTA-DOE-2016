\section*{\textbf{Plans}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I intend to supervise two undergraduate students who will work on this topic to gain research experience and provide additional manpower for simulation and hardware tasks. The project will utilize the high pressure xenon gas system which has been constructed in our lab for detector development, targetted at NEXT.  Members of the group will provide support to adapt this aparatus to this cross-cutting detector R\&D project.
