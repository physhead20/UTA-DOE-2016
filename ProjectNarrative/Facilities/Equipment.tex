At UTA we have five separate labs (electronics, optics, etc.) with several high speed oscilloscopes including one with 6 GHz bandwidth, power supplies, logic modules, and electronic racks.
In addition we host the ATLAS tier-2 computing center with large amount of computing resources.

Farbin's group has built a small High Performance cluster dedicated to                                                                                                              
GPU computing, primarily for Deep Learning studies, which are used by
over two dozen HEP collaborators over six experiments. The cluster
provides 54 processing cores (108 job slots due to hyper-threading) 
over 4 systems, with more than 4 GB of RAM per core, 2 GB/s SSD caches
in front of 50 TB of storage, 10 Gb interconnectivity, 4 NVidia (3 
Kepler, 1 Maxwell) GPUs, 3 AMD GPUs, and an Intel Phi (Knights
Corner)
Lately Yu's liquid Argon cryostat with a Argonne purification system is being constructed.

Jones and Nygren have high pressure xenon gas test equipment including recirculation system, pumps, and purifiers for detector R\&D.
