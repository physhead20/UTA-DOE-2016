Precision neutrino oscillation measurements are the cornerstone of the long-baseline neutrino program. Utilizing beams of neutrinos fired over long distance allows for the enhancement of these measurements via matter effects. These effects lead to a asymmetry between $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_{e}$ oscillation probabilities. This effect allows for the probing of CP-violating effects as well as the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy.
