We begin this section with individual summaries of the plans for each PI, which will be followed by details of the research plans organized by research areas and research topics. We begin with ATLAS, followed by the ILC. Within each research area, we describe the topics pursued by our group at UTA, laying out the research objectives, proposed methods and timetables.
