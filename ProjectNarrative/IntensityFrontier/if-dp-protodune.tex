\subsubsection{Field Cage for protoDUNE Dual Phase}
Field cages provide uniform electric fields for ionization electrons to drift to anodes for the detection in the Time Projection Chamber.
The baseline design for DUNE LAr TPC is that of the single phase in which the ionization electrons created by the secondary particles 
resulting in neutrino-nucleon interactions drift in LAr and get detected on the anode plane that resides inside the liquid phase of argon.
An alternative technology is the LAr TPC that the ionization electrons drift through LAr but then extracted through the strong extraction
field at the top of the liquid and detected in the anode in gaseous phase of argon after a signal amplification via an large area gas electron 
multiplier (LEM), hence the .
