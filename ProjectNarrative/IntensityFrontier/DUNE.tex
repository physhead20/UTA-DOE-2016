\label{sec:IF_protoDUNE}
We describe in detail the project listed in the strategic plans.   The primary goal of the projects listed in this section are to ensure
the group to play leadership role in construction of first two 10 kt modules of DUNE as well as in physics topics of the group's 
interests.

\subsubsection {Beyond the Standard Model physics group leadership - Yu}~\label{ss:dune-bsm}
In addition to the standard neutrino physics topics, neutrino mass hierarchy and CP violation measurements in the neutrino sector, the 
expected high intensity proton beams provides ample opportunities for DUNE to look for physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model.
Thanks to the consistent efforts of Yu's and other members within the DUNE collaboration, the beyond the Standard Model physics group 
has been created at the collaboration meeting in Sept. 2015 with Yu as the convener.
Yu quickly organized the group into five subgroups based on primary physics interests and to provide necessary
simulation and analysis tools specialized to support the BSM group physics analysis.
The five subgroups are the simulation and software group led by our postdoctoral fellow, Chatterjee and four physics topics what cover
Low Mass Dark Matter search (LDM), the Sterile Neutrino Search, the Non-standard Neutrino Interactions and Heavy Neutrino searches.
Additional physics topics would continued to be added to the group's interest but these four physics topics are the primary topics to be
studied in the coming 1.5 to 2 year time scale with the goal to provide the results for DUNE Technical Design Report (TDR) scheduled to compelte
by summary 2019.
In preparation for TRD, the group plans on producing the write up for the initial list of topics and tasks to complete to provide
sensitivity studies for TDR, along with the milestones for the group to follow.
We anticipate that the list of tasks will be essential for the new members to participate in BSM group's planned studies.

% ==========  DUNE Beam Simulations
%
\subsubsection {Beam Simulation Tasks for LBNF}~\label{ss:dune-beam-sim}
UTA group has contributed to beam simulations for optimization and systematic studies of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF).
All new students joining the group are required to learn root and beam simulations as part of their training process.  
Since most of these tasks are well defined, each student can be assigned to the given task until they complete the task and 
write up the report.
Many undergraduate students were able to make helpful contributions in these tasks and made presentations at beam simulation group 
meetings for tangible contributions.
We plan on continue contributing to the beam simulation group's tasks for various studies, including an improved decay pipe 
radius dependence of the CPV sensitivity, target dimenstion and material dependence of neutrino flux and magnetic field map 
computations and display.
New students will be assigned of additional tasks that are helpful for beam optimization group based on the discussion with the
leadership of the group.
This will allow students to continue improving their analysis skills while working on hardware projects.
