\subsubsection {Beyond the Standard Model physics group leadership (PI: Yu)}~\label{sec:dune-bsm}
In addition to the standard neutrino physics topics, neutrino mass hierarchy and CP violation phase measurements in the neutrino sector, the required high intensity proton beams provide ample opportunities for DUNE to look for physical phenomena beyond the Standard Model. UTA has been the leading proponent in searching for Low mass Dark Matter (LDM) in high intensity proton beams from the start of the I.F. group in 2014. For this work, Yu has been leading the BSM physics working group of DUNE since September 2015 and has grown the group to play a significant role within the collaboration. Yu plans on ensuring various BSM topics be included in the DUNE Technical Design Report (TDR) to be released in summer 2019.

In order to coordinate the group in an effective manner, Yu quickly organized the group into five subgroups based on primary physics interests and to provide necessary simulation and analysis tools specialized to support the BSM group physics analyses.
The five subgroups are the simulation and software group led by UTT's postdoctoral fellow, Chatterjee and four physics subgroups that cover LDM search (Yu, Chatterjee), the Sterile Neutrino Search, the Non-standard Neutrino Interactions searches and Heavy Neutrino searches. Additional physics topics would continued to be added to the group's interest but these four physics topics are the primary topics to be studied in the coming 1.5 to 2 year time scale with the goal to provide the results for DUNE TDR.
In preparation for TDR, the group plans on producing a document that contains the initial list of topics and tasks to complete to provide
sensitivity studies for TDR, along with the milestones for the group to follow, by the end of 2016.

\subsubsection {Beam Simulation Tasks for LBNF (PI: Yu)}~\label{sec:dune-beam-sim}
UTA group has been contributing to beam simulations for optimization and systematic uncertainty studies of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF). All new students joining the group are required to learn ROOT and G4LBNF, the GEANT4 based beam simulation package, as part of their training process.  Since most of these tasks are well defined, each student can be assigned to the given task and write up the report after the completion. Many undergraduate students were able to make useful contributions in these tasks and made presentations at beam simulation group meetings.  We plan on continue contributing to the beam simulation group's tasks for various studies, including an improved decay pipe radius dependence of CPV sensitivity, target dimension and material dependence of neutrino flux and magnetic field map computations and display. The three new undergradaute students will be assigned of additional tasks that are helpful for beam optimization group based on the discussion with the leadership of the group.  This will allow students to continue improving their analysis skills while working on hardware projects described below and prepare them for participating in data analysis in SBN experiments described in previous sections.
