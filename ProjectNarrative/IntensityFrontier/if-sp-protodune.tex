\subsection{APA QA/QC }~\label{sec:proto-dune-sp-apa}

Given that the highest priority of DUNE is to establish and demonstrate the functionality of its baseline technology, namely the single phase LArTPC, Asaadi will be focusing on the quality assurance, quality control, and commissioning of the anode plane assemblies (APA's) for protoDUNE SP. This work will help building up infrastructure, expertise, and capabilities necessary to contribute and lead in the DUNE SP far detector construction.
