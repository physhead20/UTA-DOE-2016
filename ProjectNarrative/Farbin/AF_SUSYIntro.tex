Despite no evidence of Supersymmetry (SUSY) in LHC Run 1 and early Run
2 data, this extension of the Standard Model's symmetries continues to
remain the most compelling mechanism to avoid the fine-tuning problem
of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism (the hierarchy or
naturalness problem), while also providing Gauge Unification and a
Dark Matter candidate. The current highly successful LHC run, with a
significant increased center of mass energy and integrated luminosity,
provides a brief window where data-doubling time at a new energy is
short and large strides can be made in the search for new
particles. As LHC nears end of Run 2, further strides will require
more sensitive techniques that can target difficult regions while also
searching broadly for excesses. This section overviews activities and
plans of UTA SUSY group, consisting of faculty De and Farbin, postdocs
Usai, Heelan, and new hire in 2017, and students Darmora, Bullock,
Little, and Rogers.
