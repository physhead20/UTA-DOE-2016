%% Thanks to the efforts of Chris Jones (FNAL) and other, CMS's software
%% framework (CMSSW) has gradually migrated to a multi-threading version
%% of CMSSW. ART framework branched early on from CMSSW and is
%% used by nine experiments including all LArTPC experiements because of LArSoft, 


%% As a long-term contributor and coordinator of PAT, which sits at the
%% boundry of physics and computing, Farbin has deep knowledge of ATLAS's
%% software framework and event data model, significant parts of which he lead
%% design and implement (for example the AOD/ESD merger and the principles behind xAOD).

%%  emerging computing technologies and the DL renaissance
%%  will necessitate new and radically different software frameworks for
%%  HL-LHC and DUNE, requiring R&D now and first version by 2020 for
%%  data-taking in 2025. My research is spread between several
%%  experiments on different HEP frontiers, enabling a broad perspective
%%  on the both physics and S&C in our field, in addition to my technical
%%  grasp of HEP software frameworks, automatic generators like MadGraph,
%%  GPUs, and DL.


%% . As DUNE
%% DS\&CC, I had he oppertunity to throughly review art, LArSoft, and
%% CMSWS frameworks.
