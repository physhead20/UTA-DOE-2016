The SouthWest Tier 2 center (SWT2) located at UTA and the University of Oklahoma is fully 
funded by the NSF M\&O program for USATLAS and through local support from the university. 
De is the director of the Tier 2 center, which consistently ranks as one of the top ten 
computing centers in ATLAS. While SWT2 is an important ATLAS-wide resource, the close 
proximity of almost 3 Petabytes (PB) of storage and over 4000 CPU slots plays a crucial 
role in the success of the base program at UTA, though no base funding is spent on the 
Tier 2 center. Working in conjunction with the local Tier 3 center at UTA, SWT2 enables 
the generation of rapid physics results by the UTA group.

For the next three year period proposed here, we expect SWT2 to help with the core physics 
goals of our group: the exploration of the Higgs boson, and the search for supersymmetry. 
Data processing, local storage and software caches will lead to expedited physics results 
in Run 2. This local computing expertise is particularly helpful to beginning graduate students.
