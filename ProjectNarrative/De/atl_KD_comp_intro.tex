UTA has a long history of contributions to ATLAS computing for the past 20 years. For example, UTA physicists advocated the use of C$^{++}$ and the adoption of an object oriented paradigm when ATLAS collaboration was started. We performed some of the earliest GEANT calculations to motivate the design the ITC Calorimeter built at UTA. After construction of ATLAS, UTA involvement in ATLAS Computing intensified with participation and leadership in all the MOnte Carlo Data Challenges (DC0, DC1, DC2...). Over the past 10 years, UTA has been deeply involved in ATLAS Distributed Computing (ADC), as well as in other areas of Software and Computing (S\&C) in support of the LHC physics goals. UTA hosts the SouthWest Tier 2 center, and is a cornerstone of the highly innovative PanDA system, now being used widely in many data intensive sciences. We lead US distributed computing operations, andf many other areas of service and support activities. While most of the funding for computing activities is supported through other grants, UTA base funding provides the intellectual underpinning of the entire highly successgful effort. In the following sections we describe some of the many service roles that UTA palys in S\&C.
