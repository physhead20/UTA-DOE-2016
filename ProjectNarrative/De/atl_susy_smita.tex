The heavy mass of the top quark could lead to its supersymmetric partner being the lightest squark. PI De's group has been searching for the stop in \D0\ and ATLAS since the discovery of the top quark. So far, this has led to multiple successful Ph.D. thesis from both Tevatron and LHC data -- but alas no sign of the stop. De's latest student, Smita Darmora, recently defended her Ph.D. thesis on the search for the stop in August, 2015. Her work was co-supervised by base funded researcher Guilio Usai. The title of her thesis was: ``SEARCH FOR A SUPERSYMMETRIC PARTNER TO THE TOP QUARK USING A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE.'' 

Smita's search focussed on the decay of the stop quark to a chargino and a bottom quark. The chargino subsequently decays to a lepton and missing Et (which comes from the missing neutrino and the missing LSP). The final state is then missing Et with two opposite sign leptons and two b-jets. The primary backgrounds to this channel are top pair production, di-boson production and Z plus jets. The compressed mass spectrum from the chargino neutralino mass difference leads to soft leptons makes this search challenging. We optimized the search separately for soft leptons and hard leptons. Initially, Smita tried a cut based analysis. To improve on the results obtained from the cut based analysis, a multivariate analysis was attempted. This led to a significant increase in the search sensitivity.

The multivariate analysis (MVA) technique used for this search employed a ``supervised learning'' algorithm. A Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) technique was used with a Gradient boosting algorithm, commonly known as BDTG. The TMVA training used eleven classifiers. In rank of importance, missing Et, ratio of leptonic and jet Pt's, and angle between lepton and missing Et had the highest importance. Ten of the chosen variables had non-zero significance. After a long and complicated analysis, 
Figure~\ref{smita_limit} shows the 95\% confidence limit exclusion limit for a 300 GEV mass stop obtained by Smita.
