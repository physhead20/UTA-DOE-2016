\subsection{\Large Detector R$\&$D Program Budget Justification}
{\bf Preamble:} This section provides the budget justifications for PIâ€™s Brandt, Nygren, Asaadi, and Jones related to the Detector R$\&$D proposal.  Detailed description for each of the items is given in Year 1.  A canonical cost of living adjustment rate of 3\% is applied to all salaries in the subsequent years.  Therefore,  Year 2 and Year 3 of the budget justification does not contain as much details as year 1 and instead the base rates and significant changes for each item and total amount are listed. Only PI Brandt is seeking any salary support from the Detector R$\&$D activities, Nygren, Asaadi, and Jones are seeking support for personnel and M$\&$S.

The personnel requested for these projects are: one month summer salary and half-time postdoc for PI Brandt; a half-time graduate student for PI Asaadi; a half-time graduate student for PI Jones; support for two undergraduates for PI Nygren.  All tasks are carried out on campus, and thus incur an indirect rate of 51.5\%.
